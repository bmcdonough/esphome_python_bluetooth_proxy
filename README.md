# ESPHome Python Bluetooth Proxy

A Python-based Bluetooth proxy for ESPHome devices, converting the existing C++ implementation to a more flexible and maintainable Python solution.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a Python alternative to the existing C++ ESPHome Bluetooth proxy, offering:

- **Better maintainability**: Python's readability and extensive ecosystem
- **Enhanced flexibility**: Easier customization and extension
- **Modern development practices**: Comprehensive testing, linting, and CI/CD
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Runs on various platforms with Python support

## Features

- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device discovery and communication
- Integration with ESPHome API
- Asynchronous operation for better performance
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Configurable via YAML files

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Bluetooth adapter (built-in or USB)
- ESPHome device with API enabled

## Installation

### For Users

```bash
pip install esphome-python-bluetooth-proxy
```

### For Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed development setup instructions.

## Quick Start

```python
from esphome_bluetooth_proxy import BluetoothProxy

# Initialize the proxy
proxy = BluetoothProxy()

# Start the proxy
await proxy.start()
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
esphome:
  host: "192.168.1.100"
  port: 6053
  password: "your_api_password"

bluetooth:
  scan_interval: 30
  devices:
    - name: "Temperature Sensor"
      mac: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
```
